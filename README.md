# streamlit-cement
ML Project with Streamlit deployment

* Check out this machine learning interactive application that predicts the strength of concrete using different models.
* Choose from different Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) options, apply feature engineering, and tweak a few hyperparameters tuning options.
* Test the various models and determine their accuracy.
* The application is deployed using streamlit, a versatile interactive open source framework ideal for model exploration and machine learning applications.
